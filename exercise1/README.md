# Exercise 1

## Run the scripts
- Go to each folder(`/p#`)
``` bash
makefile all
```
- For each part:
  - `p#.py`: gem5 scripts which generate the user-defined architecture
  - `parse.py`: generated by ChatGPT for data capturing (from `stats.txt`)

## Notes
- For `/p4`, we need KVM to accelerate the simulation.
